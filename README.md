# Azure Storage Demand Forecasting 

## Overview
This project focuses on preparing historical cloud storage demand data
for South India and Asian regions between 2022 and 2024.

## MileStone-1
The objective of Milestone 1 is to collect, generate, and preprocess
time-series storage usage data for future demand forecasting models.

# Work Completed
